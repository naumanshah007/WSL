def extract_lab_values(df):
    prompt = """Extract required lab values and their relationships from clinical trial data and present the results in JSON format. Ensure accurate extraction of expressions like 'less than,' 'greater than,' 'greater than or equal to,' 'less than or equal to,' 'lab value lower,' and 'lab value upper limit' specifically for the following lab values:

Hemoglobin
Hematocrit
Platelet count
White blood cell count
Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) or absolute granulocyte count
Creatinine
Creatinine clearance or GFR
AST
ALT
Albumin
Alkaline phosphatase
Bilirubin
Instructions:

For each lab value, extract the following relationships along with the lab value itself and present them in JSON format:

'less than','greater than','greater than or equal to','less than or equal to' should be represented as 'Lab Value required: ["Extracted relationship", Extracted Lab Value]' in JSON.
'lab value lower and upper should be represented as 'Lab Value required: [lab value lower limit, lab value upper limit]' in JSON.
If there is a value without a specified relationship, extract the value without the relationship and present it as 'Lab Value required: ["", Extracted Lab Value]' in JSON.
If there is no lab value, extract the value without the relationship and present it as 'Lab Value required: ["", ""]' in JSON.
Creatinine clearance or GFR are same.
Creatinine clearance and Creatinine are not same.

Special Condition:

If lab values are present in the exclusion criteria section, reverse the relationship (e.g., 'less than' becomes 'greater than,' 'greater than or equal to' becomes 'less than,' etc.).

Additional note: if relation is less than or equal to then return its complete context not just less than.

Example Format (Replace with extracted values):
{
"Hemoglobin required": ["", ""],
"Hematocrit required": ["", ""],
"Platelet count required": ["", ""],
"White blood cell required": ["", ""],
"Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) or absolute granulocyte count required": ["", ""],
"Creatinine required": ["", ""],
"Creatinine clearance or GFR required": ["", ""],
"AST required": ["", ""],
"ALT required": ["", ""],
"Albumin required": ["", ""],
"Alkaline phosphatase required": ["", ""],
"Bilirubin required": ["", ""]
}

Example Scenarios:

1. If the text states, "Inclusion criteria: Patients with hemoglobin less than 120 g/L," the expected output should be:
{
"Hemoglobin required": ["less than", "120 g/L"]
}

2. If the text states, "Exclusion criteria: Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 ml/min," the expected output should be:
{
"Creatinine clearance or GFR required": ["less than", "60 ml/min"]
}

3. If the text states, "Inclusion criteria: Platelet count greater than 150 x10^9/L and exclusion criteria: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than or equal to 1.5 x10^9/L," the expected output should be:
{
"Platelet count required": ["greater than", "150 x10^9/L"],
"Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) or absolute granulocyte count required": ["greater than", "1.5 x10^9/L"]
}

4. If the text states, "Exclusion criteria: Hemoglobin greater than 100 g/L," the expected output should be:
{
"Hemoglobin required": ["less than or equal to", "100 g/L"]
}

5. If the text states, "Exclusion criteria: Platelet count less than 50 x10^9/L," the expected output should be:
{
"Platelet count required": ["greater than or equal to", "50 x10^9/L"]
}
